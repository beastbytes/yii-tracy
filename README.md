The Yii-Tracy package integrates the [Tracy debugging tool](https://tracy.nette.org/)
into [Yii3](https://www.yiiframework.com/) by providing the necessary configuration.

## Requirements
- PHP 8.1 or higher

## Installation
Install the package using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

Either:
```shell
composer require beastbytes/yii-tracy
```
or add the following to the `require` section of your `composer.json`
```json
"beastbytes/yii-tracy": "<version_constraint>"
```

## Configuration
Yii-Tracy is configured using Yiiâ€™s configuration. It has the following configuration parameters:
* mode (null|bool|string|array) The mode that Tracy is to operate in; Development or Production.
  * `Tracy\Debugger::Detect`: Tracy detects the mode; it sets _**development mode**_ is if it is running on _localhost_
    (i.e. IP address 127.0.0.1 or ::1) and there is no proxy, otherwise it sets _**production mode**_.
  * `Tracy\Debugger::Development`: put Tracy in _**development mode**_.
  * `Tracy\Debugger::Production`: put Tracy in _**production mode**_.
  * string: enable _**development mode**_ for the given IP address.
  * string[]: enable _**development mode**_ for IP addresses in the list.

    **NOTE** It is highly recommended to combine IP addresses with a cookie token by specifying allowed addresses as 
    `<token>@<ipAddress>`; see _token_.
* editor (string) [Tracy IDE integration](https://tracy.nette.org/en/open-files-in-ide)
* email (null|string|string[]) Email address(es) to which send error notifications
* logDirectory (string) Path alias to the log directory. Default: `'@runtime/logs'`
* logSeverity (int) Log bluescreen in production mode for this error severity.
* panels (array[]) List of panels available to Tracy and their configuration.
* showBar (bool) Whether to display debug bar in _**development mode**_.
* token (string) The secret token for enabling _**development mode**_ for IP addresses. See _mode_

## Panels
Yii Tracy defines a set of panels that can be added to the debugger bar; it is also possible to add user defined panels. 
### Auth
Provides information about the current user.
### Database
Provides information about the database connection and executed queries.
### Event
Not sure what yet
### Request
Provides information about the current request.
### Route
Provides information about the current route.
### Session
Provides information about the session.
### View
Provides information about the rendered view.

## User Defined Panel
### Panel Class
The Panel class must extend `BeastBytes\Yii\Tracy\Panel\Panel`. 
The Panel class has access to Yii's Dependency Injection container through the `$container` property.

To add the panel to Tracy, add its configuration to `'beastbytes/yii-tracy'['panels']`.

See [Tracy Bar Extensions](https://tracy.nette.org/en/extensions) for more information
and examine the package's panels for example code.

The Panel class must implement the following methods:
#### panelParameters(): array
Returns view parameters for the panel view as array<string: mixed>;

#### panelTitle(): string
Returns the panel title.

#### tabIcon(array $parameters): string
Returns the icon for the debugger tab view; it must be valid SVG.

The method takes the tab parameters as a parameter to allow the icon to reflect the state of the tab;
e.g. whether any database queries were executed.

#### tabParameters(): array
Returns view parameters for the debugger tab view as array<string: mixed>;

#### tabTitle(): string
Returns the title for the debugger tab.

### Views
The panel must implement two views, _tab_ and _panel_; they are _php_ templates.
The views need only render the tab/panel content;
Yii Tracy provides layouts for both tab and panel to decorate the content.

Rendering is done using Yii\View\View.
