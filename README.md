The Yii-Tracy package integrates the [Tracy debugging tool](https://tracy.nette.org/)
into [Yii3](https://www.yiiframework.com/) by providing the necessary configuration.

## Requirements
- PHP 8.1 or higher

## Installation
Install the package using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

Either:
```shell
composer require beastbytes/yii-tracy
```
or add the following to the `require` section of your `composer.json`
```json
"beastbytes/yii-tracy": "<version_constraint>"
```

## Configuration
Yii-Tracy is configured using Yiiâ€™s configuration. It has the following configuration parameters:
* mode (null|bool|string|array) The mode that Tracy is to operate in; Development or Production.
  * `Tracy\Debugger::Detect`: Tracy detects the mode; it sets _**development mode**_ is if it is running on _localhost_
    (i.e. IP address 127.0.0.1 or ::1) and there is no proxy, otherwise it sets _**production mode**_.
  * `Tracy\Debugger::Development`: put Tracy in _**development mode**_.
  * `Tracy\Debugger::Production`: put Tracy in _**production mode**_.
  * string: enable _**development mode**_ for the given IP address.
  * string[]: enable _**development mode**_ for IP addresses in the list.

    **NOTE** It is highly recommended to combine IP addresses with a cookie token by specifying allowed addresses as 
    `<token>@<ipAddress>`; see _token_.
